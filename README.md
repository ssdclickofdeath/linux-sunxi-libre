#Linux Sunxi Libre Mirror
This repository is a mirror of the port of linux-sunxi-libre that *was* hosted at [http://platen-software.de/linux-sunxi/](http://platen-software.de/linux-sunxi/), but now gives a 404 error.

The file is split up into three parts due to GitHub's size limit. The parts can be rejoined with 7-zip.

##Checksum
You can find a SHA1 checksum in the file linux-sunxi-libre-3.4.75.tar.bz2.sha1. Be aware that this is for the file reconstructed from the three split files.

##License
Like the kernel Linux, it is released under the GNU General Public License, version 2. The GPLv2 is reproduced in the LICENSE file for convenience
